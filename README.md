# Telecom_Churn_Analysis

#Project Summary
Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription. This project aims to use the available information to analyze which consumers will likely quit a company, enabling the corporation to make better-informed decisions.

#Problem Statement
Telecommunication companies have a significant problem with customer churn, which is the loss of customers who stop using their services. 
To solve this problem, telco's need to identify the customers who are likely to churn and take preemptive measures to retain them.
